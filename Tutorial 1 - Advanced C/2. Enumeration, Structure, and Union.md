# 2. Enumeration, Structure, and Union

## Enumeration
**enumeration** (aka Enum): User-defined data type for assigning names to constants, so the code becomes more legible.

```c
enum week {
    sunday, 
    monday, 
    tuesday, 
    wednesday, 
    thursday, 
    friday, 
    saturday
};
/**
 * sunday corresponds to 0
 * monday corresponds to 1
 * ...
 * saturday corresponds to 6
 * /
```

#### Sample Code
```c
#include <stdio.h> 

enum week {
    sunday, 
    monday = 0, 
    tuesday = 3
};
  
int main() { 
   printf("%d, %d, %d\n", sunday, monday, tuesday); 
   return 0; 
}
```

You can also declare enum variables.

```c
// creating an enum variable called `day` of type `week`

enum week {
    sunday, 
    monday, 
    tuesday
} day;

/*--- OR ---*/

enum week {
    sunday, 
    monday, 
    tuesday
};
enum week day;
```

#### Sample Code
```c
#include <stdio.h> 
  
enum week {
    sunday, 
    monday = 3, 
    tuesday
}; 
  
int main() { 
    enum week day; 
    day = tuesday; 
    printf("%d\n", day); 
    return 0;
}
```

## Struct
**struct**: User-defined data type for combining data items with different types into one.

```c
struct USTMember {
    char name[20];
    int ID;
    int age;
} student;
/**
 *  `USTMember` is an optional structure tag.
 *  `student` is a variable name of type `struct USTMember`.
 *  Declaring variables after the struct is optional.
 */
```
You can access members of the structure using the dot operator `.`. For example: `Student.ID` or `Student.age`.

#### Sample Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct USTMember {
    char name[20];
    int ID;
    int age;
};

void print_info(struct USTMember student) {
    printf("Student Name : %s\n", student.name);
    printf("Student ID : %d\n", student.ID);
    printf("Student Age : %d\n", student.age);   
}

int main() {
    struct USTMember student; /* variable `student` of type `USTMember` */
    strcpy(student.name, "John");
    student.ID = 1010;
    student.age = 18;
    
    print_info(student);
    return 0;
}
```

To access members of pointers to struct, use `->` instead of `.`.

```c
struct USTMember* student;
student->ID = 1010;
student->age = 18;
```
___
## Union
**union**: Data-type which stores data items with different types in the same memory location.

```c
union Data {
   int i;
   float f;
   char s[15];
} data;
/**
 *  `Data` is an optional union tag.
 *  `data` is a variable of type `union Data`.
 *  Declaring variables after the union is optional.
 * /
```

#### Sample Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
 
union Data {
   int i;
   float f;
   char s[15];
};
 
int main() {
   union Data data; /* variable `data` of type Data */ 

   data.i = 1;
   data.f = 3.14;
   strcpy(data.s, "Robotics team");

   printf("data.i : %d\n", data.i);
   printf("data.f : %f\n", data.f);
   printf("data.str : %s\n", data.s);

   return 0;
}
```
Note that prior to printing the data members, the final value set is `"Robotics team"` to the `char s[15]` member.

The result would be chaotic because all data members are stored in the same memory. The printed values will correspond to "Robotics team" in their own data type.
