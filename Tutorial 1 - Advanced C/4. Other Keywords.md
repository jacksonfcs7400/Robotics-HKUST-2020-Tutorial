# 4. Other Keywords

**`static`** : variables / functions with this keyword can only be accessed within the scope they're declared in. 

```c
static int x = 0;
```

Their values will persist throughout the scope of a function or block.

**`extern`** : variables need to be declared with this keyword when they are accessed from external files.

#### Sample Code
```c
// library.c
int a = 100;
```
```c
// main.c
#include <stdio.h>

extern int a;

int main() {
    printf("a = ", a);
    return 0;
}
```


**`inline`** : functions defined with this keyword would expand to their definition within the code when they are called.

> ### What's good about inline functions?
> Inline functions expand their definition where called. This may help save cpu memory resources and time.

> Inline functions are cool, but if you inline a *huge* function it could increase code size unnecessarily. So usually we only use this keyword on small and light functions.
